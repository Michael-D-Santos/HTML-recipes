    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A personal take on this amazing Italian custard pudding. Above and beyond that rich and decadent butterscotch flavor, the texture here is unbelievable. To say it's smooth and luxurious doesn't come close to doing it justice. Serve as-is, with whipped cream, or topped with caramel sauce and flaky sea salt.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups heavy cream</li>
        <li><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white rum</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, salt, and water in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil; cook until the caramel is very dark, and bubbles appear, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately turn off heat.</li>
        <li>Carefully whisk in 2 tablespoons butter; pour in heavy cream and continue to stir. Be careful, as the mixture may boil up in the pan. Stir over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Whisk in milk.</li>
        <li>Whisk whole egg, egg yolks, and 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch together in a mixing bowl. Slowly whisk in 1 cup of the hot cream mixture to temper the egg mixture. Whisk the egg mixture into the saucepan and increase heat to medium-high. Bring to a simmer, and cook, whisking, until the mixture thickens, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and pour into a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl to remove any lumps. Whisk in rum.</li>
        <li>Pour into serving glasses. Let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes, before wrapping in plastic wrap and refrigerating until thoroughly chilled, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
      </ol>
